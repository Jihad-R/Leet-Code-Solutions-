#   Max Consecutive Ones {Easy}
This problem basically wants us to find the greatest number of consecutive ones in an array. Consecutive means one after the other btw.  

For example this array --> [1,0,1,1,0,1] has **2** consecutive ones [1,0,**1**,**1**,0,1].

## Solution

I am a beginner with this competitve programming ordeal and most of my solution are quite naive. But I feel the approach we will be using for this problem is fairly efficent when compared to our skill level. First I will post the code block then we can go step by step to explain it. 


### Java Solution 

    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        
        int max =0;  # this variable holds the maximum number of consecutive ones in an array 
        int current = 0; # this variable keeps track and increments everytime there is a series of ones
        
        for(int n : nums){  # Don't get scared this line just gives us an easy for loop that we can work with
                            # it is not your conventional for loop but if you have ever coded in python it is very similar...
                            # to the for loop in python it basically means for every element (n) in the array (nums)
                            # meaning that n is the element and we don't need to use the index syntax (array[index]) to grab the elements in an array
                            # we can simply use n to grab the element using this special for loop syntax
                            # I hope that is clear ðŸ˜…
                            
            if(n == 1)      # Now we check if n is equal
            {
                current++; # incase the condition is true we increment the current variable by 1 
                max = Math.max(current, max); # then we compare it with the max number of 1s we currently have, since this is our 
                                              # first trial the max = 0 and the current variable has been incremeanted by one the new value of
                                              # max will be 1 and this comparison keeps on happening every time we incounter a 1
            }
            else  # Now the fun part is here when we incounter a number that is not a one the following happens
            {                 
                current = 0; # The current variable we used to track the number of ones becomes zero. This makes sense because we are looking for consecutive
                             # ones and since we incounter a number that is not one we should reset our current variable.
            }
        }
        
        # we do this until we traverse the whole array leaving us with an linear time complexity O(N) 
        
        return max;
        
    }
    }

I have also provided the solution in python code for anyone who is interested.  It is esstentially the same thing as the Java solution but just in different syntax


### Python Solution


        current = 0
        max_num = 0
        
        for i in nums: 
            if(i == 1):
                current+=1
                max_num = max(current,max_num)
                
            else:
                current = 0
                
        return max_num
